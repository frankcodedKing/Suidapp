It’s also a part of blockchains that are least developed, at least from a research point of view. So while it’s true that if you look at how different blockchains were in the engineering sense, especially regarding capabilities of L1s, if you look at it from building distributed systems, many of the engineering computer science models are available so you can figure out what you’re doing, what these networks are providing make sense or not. Tokenomics is not there at all if you look at the research, and you can even make very simple issues look not-so-simple, but things that should be well known like proof of work or proof of stake, the economics results are very behind.",date:"2022-07-19",heroImage:l,image:l,subroute:a,categoryName:f,catRoute:[b],catId:a,author:c},{title:"Announcing Sui Tokenomics",link:"announcing-sui-tokenomics",excerpt:"Today, we are equally excited to share the design of Sui’s economics and incentives — also known as Sui’s tokenomics.
