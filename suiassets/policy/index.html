HOW WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION</strong><br>We disclose your information to third parties for a variety of business purposes, including to provide our Services, to protect us or others, or in the event of a major business transaction such as a merger, sale, or asset transfer, as described below.</p><p><strong>A. Disclosures to Provide our Services</strong><br>The categories of third parties with whom we may share your information are described below.</p><ul><li>Notice Regarding Use of Blockchain. Transactions on the Services will be conducted via the Sui Blockchain. Information about your transfers will be provided to the Sui Blockchain and may be accessible to third parties due to the public nature of the Blockchain. Because entries to the Sui Blockchain are, by their nature, public, and because it may be possible for someone to identify you through your pseudonymous, public wallet address using external sources of information, any transaction you enter onto the Sui Blockchain could possibly be used to identify you, or information about you.</li><li>Other Users of the Services and Parties You Transact With. Some of your personal information may be visible to other users of the Services (e.g., information featured on generally accessible parts of your profile; usernames of other Mysten Labs Services users). In addition, to complete transfers via the Services, we will need to share some of your personal information with the party that you are transacting with.</li><li>Third Party Websites and Applications. You may choose to share personal information or interact with third-party websites and/or third-party applications, including, but not limited to, third-party electronic wallet extensions. Once your personal information has been shared with a third-party website or a third-party application, it will also be subject to such third party’s privacy policy. We encourage you to closely read each third-party website or third-party application privacy policy before sharing your personal information or otherwise interacting with them. Please note that we do not control, and we are not responsible for the third-party website’s or the third-party application’s processing of your personal information.</li><li>Service Providers. We may share your personal information with our third-party service providers who use that information to help us provide our Services. This includes service providers that provide us with IT support, hosting, customer service, and related services.</li><li>Business Partners. We may share your personal information with business partners to provide you with a product or service you have requested. We may also share your personal information to business partners with whom we jointly offer products or services.</li><li>Affiliates. We may share your personal information with members of our corporate family.</li><li>Other Users/Website Visitors. As described above in “<a href="#personal-information-we-collect">Personal Information We Collect</a>,” our Services allow you to share your profile and/or User Content with other users or publicly, including to those who do not use our Services.</li><li>Advertising Partners. We may share your personal information with third-party advertising partners. These third-party advertising partners may set Technologies and other tracking tools on our Services to collect information regarding your activities and your device (e.g., your IP address, cookie identifiers, page(s) visited, location, time of day). These advertising partners may use this information (and similar information collected from other services) for purposes of delivering personalized advertisements to you when you visit digital properties within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as “interest-based advertising” or “personalized advertising.”</li><li>APIs/SDKs. We may use third-party application program interfaces (“<strong>APIs</strong>”) and software development kits (“SDKs”) as part of the functionality of our Services. For more information about our use of APIs and SDKs, please contact us as set forth in <a href="#contact-us">“Contact Us”</a> below.</li></ul><p><strong>B. Disclosures to Protect Us or Others</strong><br>We may access, preserve, and disclose any information we store associated with you to external parties if we, in good faith, believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement or national security requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; protect your, our, or others’ rights, property, or safety; enforce our policies or contracts; collect amounts owed to us; or assist with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity.</p><p><strong>C. Disclosure in the Event of Merger, Sale, or Other Asset Transfers</strong><br>If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, financing due diligence, reorganization, bankruptcy, receivership, purchase or sale of assets, or transition of service to another provider, your information may be sold or transferred as part of such a transaction, as permitted by law and/or contract.</p><p><strong>6. YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES AND RIGHTS</strong><br><strong>Your Privacy Choices.</strong> The privacy choices you may have about your personal information are determined by applicable law and are described below.</p><ul><li><strong>Email Communications.</strong><br>If you receive an unwanted email from us, you can use the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of the email to opt out of receiving future emails. Note that you will continue to receive transfer-related emails regarding Services you have requested.

(The referred party may also receive rewards for signing up via your referral.) These programs are entirely voluntary and allow us to grow our business and provide additional benefits to you. The value of your data to us depends on how you ultimately use our Services, whereas the value of the referred party’s data to us depends on whether the referred party ultimately becomes a user and uses our Services. Said value will be reflected in the incentive offered in connection with each program.</p><p><strong>Accessibility. </strong>This Privacy Policy uses industry-standard technologies and was developed in line with the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, version 2.1.
