(<strong>“Mysten Labs,” “we,” “our”</strong>), ”), which may facilitate interaction with the Sui decentralized cryptographic protocols, which we do not own or control, (the <strong>“Protocol”</strong>) allowing for activities such as the creation of non-fungible tokens (“<strong>NFTs</strong>”), ”), blockchain games, DeFi apps, marketplaces, automated market makers, and wallets. To make these Terms easier to read, the Interface collectively includes the Site and the App.</p><p>Mysten Labs does not own or control the Protocol. The Protocol is maintained by the open source community and unaffiliated third parties. As such, the Interface specifically excludes the Protocol. Mysten Labs does not undertake any obligations with respect to the Protocol. YOUR USE OF THE PROTOCOL IS COMPLETELY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p><p><strong>WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS, YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND MYSTEN LABS THROUGH BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT. PLEASE REVIEW CAREFULLY SECTION 17 “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” BELOW FOR DETAILS REGARDING ARBITRATION. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION WHERE APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES, THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IN SECTION 17 WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU BUT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 16 (GOVERNING LAW) WILL APPLY INSTEAD.</strong></p><p><strong>1. Agreement to Terms.</strong> By using our Interface, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you don’t agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Interface. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the laws of some jurisdictions may limit or not permit certain provisions of this agreement, such as indemnification, the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability. In such a case, such provisions will apply only to the maximum extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Also, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing in these terms will prejudice such rights that you may have as a consumer of the Interface under such Applicable Law.</p><p><strong>2. Privacy Policy.</strong> Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Interface, for information on how we collect, use and share your information.</p><p><strong>3. Changes to these Terms or the Interface. </strong>We may update the Terms from time to time in our sole discretion. If we do, we’ll let you know by posting the updated Terms on the Site, to the App and/or may also send other communications. It’s important that you review the Terms whenever we update them or you use the Interface. If you continue to use the Interface after we have posted updated Terms it means that you accept and agree to the changes. If you don’t agree to be bound by the changes, you may not use the Interface anymore. Because our Interface is evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Interface, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.</p><p><strong>4. Who May Use the Interface?</strong><br>The Interface is only available to users in certain jurisdictions who can use the Interface as permitted under Applicable Law. Without limitation, you must be at least 18 years of age to use the Interface. You may not attempt to access or use the Interface if you are not permitted to do so.“” OUR INTERFACE IS NOT OFFERED TO PERSONS OR ENTITIES WHO RESIDE IN, ARE LOCATED IN, ARE INCORPORATED IN, OR HAVE A REGISTERED OFFICE IN ANY RESTRICTED TERRITORY, AS DEFINED BELOW (ANY SUCH PERSON OR ENTITY FROM A RESTRICTED TERRITORY, A “<strong>RESTRICTED PERSON</strong>”).

In addition to the other suspension and termination rights in these Terms, we may suspend or terminate your access to the Interface at any time in connection with any transaction as required by Applicable Law, any governmental authority, or if we in our sole and reasonable discretion determine you are violating the terms of any third-party service provider or these Terms, including, without limitation, if we reasonably believe any of your representations and warranties may be untrue or inaccurate or you are violating or have violated any of the geographical restrictions that apply to the Interface, and we will not be liable to you for any losses or damages you may suffer as a result of or in connection with the Site or the Interface being inaccessible to you at any time or for any reason. Such suspension or termination shall not be constituted a breach of these Terms by Mysten Labs. In accordance with its anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism, anti-fraud, and other compliance policies and practices, we may impose limitations and controls on the ability of you or any beneficiary to utilize the Interface.

Governing Law and Forum Choice.</strong> These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, federal arbitration law, and the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in Section 17 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Mysten Labs are not required to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in San Mateo, California, and you and Mysten Labs each waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts.</p><p><strong>18. Dispute Resolution. </strong><br>(a) <u>Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes</u>. (a) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Interface (collectively, <strong>“Disputes”</strong>) will be resolved <strong>solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding</strong>. You and Mysten Labs agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and Mysten Labs are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms.</p><p>(b) <u>Exceptions</u>. . As limited exceptions to Section 17(a) above: (i) we both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.</p><p>(c) <u>Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules</u>. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“<strong>AAA</strong>”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “<strong>AAA Rules</strong>”) then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at <a href="www.adr.html">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at <a href="www.adr.html">www.adr.org</a>.</p><p>Any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this arbitration agreement.</p><p>(d) <u>Arbitration Costs</u>. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we prevail in arbitration we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under Applicable Law.</p><p>(e) <u>Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</u>. Except as provided in Section 17(b) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual claims in arbitration.</p><p>(f) <u>Class Action Waiver</u>. <strong>YOU AND MYSTEN LABS AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. </strong>. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.</p><p>(g) <u>Severability</u>. With the exception of any of the provisions in Section 17(f) of these Terms (“<strong>Class Action Waiver</strong>”), if an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will still apply.</p><p><strong>19. General Terms. </strong><br>(a) <u>Reservation of Rights</u>. Mysten Labs and its licensors exclusively own all right, title and interest in and to the Interface, including all associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Interface is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United States and foreign countries. You agree not to remove, alter or obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Interface.</p><p>(b) <u>Entire Agreement</u>.These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Mysten Labs and you regarding the Interface, and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Mysten Labs and you regarding the Interface. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable by an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Except where provided by Applicable Law in your jurisdiction, you may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Mysten Labs’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms absent our consent or your statutory right, will be null. Mysten Labs may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p><p>(c) <u>Notices</u>. Any notices or other communications provided by Mysten Labs under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Interface. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.</p><p>(d) <u>Waiver of Rights</u>. Mysten Labs’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Mysten Labs. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.</p><p><strong>20.
