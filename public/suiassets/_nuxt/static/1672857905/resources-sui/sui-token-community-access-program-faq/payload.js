The Testnet will gradually introduce and stress-test the key features, mechanisms required for a decentralized, production-ready Sui network. The Testnet aims to validate our designs, test our validator, full node, wallet, and developer toolchains, and build operational experience with a cohesive group of high-quality operators. We will graduate from Testnet to mainnet when we are fully confident in the security and performance of our software, have seen sustained operational excellence from our initial validators, and validate our developer experience via compelling Move-powered applications deployed on Testnet.",date:"2022-06-30",heroImage:q,image:q,categoryName:c,catRoute:[b],catId:a,author:d},{title:"Announcing Sui Fullnode",link:"announcing-sui-fullnode",excerpt:"Mysten Labs welcomes you to run your own Sui fullnode on DevNet.
